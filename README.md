## Traffic Lights

The main point of this project is to recreate a traffic light using the BASYS 3 and VHDL. For this, we will use a FSM - Finite State Machine - with the following diagram:

The program will control the 3 discs for vehicles: green, amber and red, as well as the 2 indicators for pedestrians: green and red. In addition, it will have a numerical indicator that will inform the time left to pedestrians to cross the street. It will have a pedestrian crossing request button, which when activated will start a timed sequence that can be implemented with FSM, as shwon in the image below.
